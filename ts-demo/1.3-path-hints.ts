// Instructions:
// Sometimes typescript has trouble figuring out what to import,
// like with the function below that resides in a regular .js file.
// Even so, it will help you finding valid paths to your modules.
// Start typing an import from ../component/js-with-export.js and you'll
// get auto completions along the way.
sayHej()

// Now that you've imported the function once, if you try to auto import
// it again from somewhere else, typescript will know about it. So you only
// need to do this manual work once per import.
