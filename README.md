# DX, what is it?

If you are a frontend developer, you primarily write code with the end user of the application in mind. However, there's a second user that you should always think about when writing code. The developer. We call the experiences that these two groups have **User Experience (UX)** and **Developer Experience (DX)**, and today I want to talk about DX.

Creating a good experience for the developer is crucial for maintaining both speed and motivation in a product organisation. However, it is often hard to defend spending time on DX while shipping code intended for the organisations primary focus, the user. Therefore I want TODO...

It is hard to talk concretely about DX because it can mean so many things, but to me I know the DX is good when I feel like I'm in a flow state. TODO....

- Decrease the cognitive load
- Increase the output speed
- Reduce friction
- Speed up the feedback loop

With this little project I want to showcase some technology that could improve the Menti DX in several of these areas. I have prepared a github repo with some examples of these DX improvements in action, so that you too can get a feel for what great DX can feel like.
